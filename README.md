Monty Interpreter

A language interpreter made in the C programming language to manage stacks and queues (LIFO and FIFO). The aim is to interpret Monty bytecodes files. Monty is a language that aims to close the gap between scripting and programming languages.



Requirements

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c90

All your files should end with a new line

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable

No more than 5 functions per file

You are allowed to use the C standard library

The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h

Donâ€™t forget to push your header file

All your header files should be include guarded

You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project

Compilation

To compile this project, you can use the following command:



$ make

Allowable opcodes and what they do

opcodefunctionality

pushadd element to the top of stack and end of queue

popremove element from top of stack and end of queue

pallprint every member of the structure

pintprints the member value at the top of stack

swapswaps the order of the 1st and 2nd elements in stack

addadd top two member values

subsubtract the top element from the 2nd top element

divdivide the 2nd element by the top element

mulmultiply the top two elements of the stack

modthe remainder when the 2nd element is divided by the top element

commentthere is the ability to parse comments found in bytecode ->#

pcharprint character at the top of the stack

pstrprint the character at the top of the stack

rotlmoves element at the top to the bottom of the stack

rotrthe bottom of the stack becomes the top

queue, stacktoggles the doubly link list implementation style

nopopcode should do nothing
